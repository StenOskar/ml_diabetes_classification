# Assignment 2
### Group 4: Sten Oskar Halse and Mats Bakketeig
#### Group work:

The group collaboration worked fine throughout the assignment. The group agreed early upon how they
would work and what they were going to do. The group did not delegate tasks but worked together
through active discussion. This worked well as the assignment required a lot of interpretation of
data and the dataset. We found it easier to work on one machine, so we did pair-programming
throughout the project.
